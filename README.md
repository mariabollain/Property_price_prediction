# Property Price Prediction 

## Overview

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict house selling prices based on various property features. Additionally, it includes an exploration of housing characteristics and factors influencing premium property values.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on 22,000 properties, representing historic data of houses sold in King County (Washington, USA), between May 2014 and May 2015. 

## Project Objectives

1.  Understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - 650K dollars and above.

2. Predict the price of a property based on the features provided in the dataset.
